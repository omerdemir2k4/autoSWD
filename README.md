# autoSWD

This repository provides a full pipeline for **automated spike-and-wave discharge (SWD) detection** in **GAERS rats** using **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)** in a **hybrid CNN + multi-kernel Conv1D model with attention** and an **Attention-ResUNet model** with **encoder-decoder architecture**.

## Data
Data is created using EDF files and Excel annotations. The workflow is optimized for **09:00â€“12:00 recordings**, following the experimental protocol.

- EDF files containing the EEG data could be found in the Google Drive link [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bqY_G_6VvcQRkN-f3o6o6yZmAjfwrB9j?usp=drive_link)

- Excel files containing start-end times and durations of marked SWDs could be found [here](https://github.com/omerdemir2k4/autoSWD/tree/main/Data/excel_file).

## LOOCV
As a testing measure, LOOCV was performed for 13 different recordings. Each one of the recordings was left out one by one, while the rest of the 12 recordings were used to train the models, and testing was done for the left-out recording.
